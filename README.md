# Safeguard-Category-Prediction-for-HAZOP-records
This is a project I used to identify the safeguard categories in a Safety Review Workshop, such as HAZOP and LOPA workshops. 
This readme only aims to give the reader a brief introductions of:
1. The background for the applied field - functional safety.
2. The 


# HAZOP and LOPA
HAZOP and LOPA workshops are the main parts of the first phase of the IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 lifecycle. The objective these two activities is to investgiate and predict all the specific harzards within a industrial plant, and find out the existing safegaurds in the design, and the risk gap to prevent the hazards.

Safeguards
The safeguards identified in the study need to be passed into different departments for detailed design and deployment. 
The most common safegaurds in the industry are "Alarms", "Basic Process Control System Interlocks", "Relief devices", "Safety Instrumentted Functions" and "Passive preventions".
